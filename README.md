## About the Sketch Library
The CBP Design System Sketch Libary is a resource to allow consumers of the CBP Design System to quickly and consistently create mockups within the Sketch application. 

### How do i add the Sketch Library?
In order to use this resource there are several prerequisites required before trying to download this file. 
- You must be working from an Apple Macintosh OS computer. Sketch does not currently support desktop Windows machines. Though Sketch does have a browser-based offering.
- You must have a license or subscription to use the Sketch Application. [Download Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
- You must download and install the required font files to your Font Book application on your mac. First, download the following font files.
    - Roboto from Google Fonts. First, you will need to click the "download family" button from this page [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). Then you will need to unzip the folder and drag all of the .ttf files to your Font Book application on your mac into your "All Fonts" folder.
    - Roboto Mono from Google Fonts. First, you will need to click the "download family" button from this page [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mono). Then you will need to unzip the folder and drag all of the .ttf files to your Font Book application on your mac into your "All Fonts" folder.
    - Font Awesome 6. The CBP uses the **free version** of the Font Awesome Icon library. First, visit this page [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/download) and click on the download button for the "Free for Desktop" set of icons. Unzip that folder. In that folder you will find another folder labled "otfs". Drag all of those files into the "All Fonts" folder in your Font Book application.
 
- Once you have the font files installed on your system click this link to add the Sketch Library File to your Sketch application: [Add Sketch Library](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fus-cbp.github.io%2Fcbp-ds-for-designers%2Fsketch.rss)
