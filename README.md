- Sketch Library 



## About the Sketch Library
The CBP Design System Sketch Libary is a resource to allow consumers of the CBP Design System to quickly and consistently create mockups within the Sketch application. 



### Installation Instructions for Adding the Sketch Library file to Your System
In order to use this resource there are several prerequisites required before trying to download this file. 
- You must be working from an Apple Macintosh OS computer. Sketch does not currently support desktop Windows machines. Though Sketch does have a browser-based offering.
- You must have a license or subscription to use the Sketch Application. [Download Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
- To begin, you must FIRST download and install the required font files to your Font Book application on your mac. Failure to install these fonts correctly before opening the library file will cause all elements that utilize font stylings to break.
  
    - Roboto from Google Fonts. First, you will need to click the "download family" button from this page [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto). Then you will need to unzip the folder and drag all of the .ttf files to your Font Book application on your mac into your "All Fonts" folder.
    - Roboto Mono from Google Fonts. First, you will need to click the "download family" button from this page [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mono). Then you will need to unzip the folder and drag all of the .ttf files to your Font Book application on your mac into your "All Fonts" folder.
    - Font Awesome 6. The CBP DS uses the **FREE version** of the Font Awesome Icon library. First, visit this page [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/download) and click on the download button for the "Free for Desktop" set of icons. Unzip that folder. In that folder you will find another folder labled "otfs". Drag all of those files into the "All Fonts" folder in your Font Book application.
 

Once you have the font files installed on your system click this link to add the Sketch Library File to your Sketch application: [Add Sketch Library](sketch://add-library?url=https%3A%2F%2Fus-cbp.github.io%2Fcbp-ds-for-designers%2Fsketch.rss)  

Upon clicking this link, you should be directed to your Sketch desktop application to confirm that you want to add this library file. 



### Keeping the CBP Design System Library File Up-To-Date
If you followed the installation instructions above correctly, then keeping your local version of the Sketch library should be very simple. Whenever there is an update to the Sketch library file then any file you use that utilizes the CBP DS Sketch library will update upon clicking the notification icon in the top-right corner of your Sketch application and selecting "library Updates Available." This will tell Sketch to update your library file and will show you what has changed between your version and this one. 

**DO NOT** make changes directly to the CBP DS Sketch library file. If you do, then when you update your version of the library file any of these overrides may be lost. If you need an alternate version of a particular component try clicking on that component and "make it local" so that you detach any changes you are making from an element in the library file.



## Something Broken?
If you find an error, or something that is not working with the CBP DS Sketch Library file, please open a github issue in our repo. We cannot guarantee that we will make any suggested change, or on what timeline that a change may occur as we have a small team. But we appreciate your feedback and encourage you to submit issues when you find them.



## Library File Status

### September 2023
The CBP DS library file has been made available for download. The file should be considered as in "Alpha" status and will change frequently with little or no warning. At this stage we encourage users to download and try out the library file with the understanding that this file and all of its components will likely change significantly before a wider release campaign begins for the CBP Design System.
